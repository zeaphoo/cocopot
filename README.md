    ~ What is Flagon?

      Flagon is a microframework for Python which provide same interface
      with Flask, except jinja2 template and signals. It's intended for 
      focus on mobile service development, which not handle html rendering.

    ~ Is it ready?

      It's still in alpha state.

    ~ What do I need?

      `pip` or `easy_install` will install them for you if you do
      `pip install Flagon`.  I encourage you to use a virtualenv.

      instructions.
