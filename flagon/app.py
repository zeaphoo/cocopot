class Flagon(object):
    """The flagon object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an `__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a `.py` file).

    Usually you create a :class:`Flagon` instance in your main module or
    in the `__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flagon import Flagon
        app = Flagon(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in `yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flagon('yourapplication')
            app = Flagon(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flagon-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplication.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

        Example::

        functions are called just before the request context moves from the

        such constructs in tests.

        Generally teardown functions must take every necessary step to avoid
        that they will fail.  If they do execute code that might fail they
        will have to surround the execution of these code by try/except
        statements and log occurring errors.

        be passed an error object.
