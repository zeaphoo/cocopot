# Request Context

## Object Proxies

Some of the objects like `request, g` provided by Cocopot are proxies to other objects. The reason behind this is that these proxies are shared between threads and they have to dispatch to the actual object bound to a thread behind the scenes as necessary.

```python
from cocopot import request, g
app = Cocopot()

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    g.foo = 'ok'

@app.route('/hello')
def hello_world():
    return g.foo
```

## Request Hooks and Processing

Cocopot application provides `before_request, after_request, teardown_request` callbacks in request processing.

The before_request will triggered before processing the request. The callbacks does not need accept any parameters, in this callback, request context has been created, so request and g object is available. It is often check session, create necessary db connection and etc.

```Python
@app.before_request
def before_request():
    g.db = DBConnection() #
```

The after_request will triggered after request been processed without exception. The callback must accept a response object as parameter and should return a response.

```python
@app.after_request
def after_request1(resp):
    return resp
```

The teardown_request will triggered when request context will be destroyed, so after request been processed with or without exception, the teardown_request callbacks will be called. The callback must accept a exception object as parameter, it is the exception occurred in processing the request, include before_request, after_request else it will be None.

```python
@app.teardown_request
def teardown_request(exc):
    pass
```

This `before_request, after_request, teardown_request` callback can be added multiple times. The callbacks executed as the order as added.

Blueprint object also provides `before_request, after_request, teardown_request` for the blueprint object, it will only triggered when the endpoint is in this blueprint. Blueprint provides the application level callbacks for insert some action in processing, `before_app_request, after_app_request, teardown_app_request`.

# Errors

What happens if an error occurs during request processing? The behavior is quite simple:

Before each request, before_request() functions are executed. If one of these functions return a response, the other functions are no longer called. In any case however the return value is treated as a replacement for the viewâ€™s return value.

If the before_request() functions did not return a response, the regular request handling kicks in and the view function that was matched has the chance to return a response.

The return value of the view is then converted into an actual response object and handed over to the after_request() functions which have the chance to replace it or modify it in place.

At the end of the request the teardown_request() functions are executed. This always happens, even in case of an unhandled exception down the road or if a before-request handler was not executed yet or at all (for example in test environments sometimes you might want to not execute before-request callbacks).


Now what happens on errors? If an exception is not caught, the 500 internal server handler is called.
