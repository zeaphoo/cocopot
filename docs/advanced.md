# Request Context

# Errors

What happens if an error occurs during request processing? The behavior is quite simple:

Before each request, before_request() functions are executed. If one of these functions return a response, the other functions are no longer called. In any case however the return value is treated as a replacement for the viewâ€™s return value.

If the before_request() functions did not return a response, the regular request handling kicks in and the view function that was matched has the chance to return a response.

The return value of the view is then converted into an actual response object and handed over to the after_request() functions which have the chance to replace it or modify it in place.

At the end of the request the teardown_request() functions are executed. This always happens, even in case of an unhandled exception down the road or if a before-request handler was not executed yet or at all (for example in test environments sometimes you might want to not execute before-request callbacks).


Now what happens on errors? If an exception is not caught, the 500 internal server handler is called.
